Hello! I'm Dongyu, currently working at ByteDance Inc. in the AML-Enterprise-Machine Learning Platform. I earned my PhD in Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I conducted research in the [DAISY Lab](https://daisy.wpi.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst). My research expertise lies in Large Language Models (LLM), prompt engineering, and natural language processing (NLP).
